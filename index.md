## **ABOUT ME....**
### ***AS A PROGRAMMER***
My first introduction to computer science was in my sophomore year of highschool, where I took an introduction to computer science course. The first programming language that I learned was [*NetLogo*](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). *NetLogo* involved typing a lot of `ask patches`. Throughout my journey as a programmer I have picked up the following progamming languages:
- NetLogo
- Python
- C++
- Java
- HTML & CSS
- MATLAB

A quote that I often refer back to in life is:
